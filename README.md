## Process

* I created a horizontal bar chart to visualize the average clicks for each content category. The monthly newsletter got the most clicks by far, and from my analysis, this was likely because the newsletter was released once a month and contained information that was important to customers. This means that when the company wants to share crucial news or vital updates to their customers, they should add it to their newsletter to leverage viewership.

* Next, I wanted to see the type of post that garnered the most impressions, and I visualized that in a horizontal bar chart. The data showed that newsletters got the most impressions, solidifying them as the most effective avenue to spread the company's brand message. Instagram posts came in second place, followed by LinkedIn Posts.

* After that, I wanted to find out how many clicks the company generates from all platforms per month, so I created a line chart. This will let me know the times of the year when consumers are most active. The data showed that consumer activity was fairly the same until August, then it ticked up from September to November and went back to previous levels in December. This means that consumers are more active towards the holiday period and are more likely to click ads then.

* I wanted to know the content category that drives the most engagement, so I created a vertical bar chart to find the average clickthrough rate of each content category. The monthly newsletter came out on top; however, the second in line was Humor, meaning people are likely to engage in posts that make them laugh. Drilling down into the data behind the types of posts in the Humor category made me realize that Instagram posts drive more engagement in this category. Knowing this information, the social media manager can apply what is working on Instagram to LinkedIn to grow engagement there.

* My next objective was to find the day of the week that garnered the most impressions. This was Sunday, closely followed by Saturday, and the next on the list of Friday. This means consumers are more available during the weekends and are more likely to view ads then.

* The company ran ads in multiple languages, and the ones in English garnered the most impressions and clicks. This means that most potential customers are likely to be English speakers.

* Lastly, I wanted to find the type of content that attracts the most engagement, so I made a multi-row card that shows the average clickthrough rate of each type of content. From the visual, it was evident that newsletters have the highest click-through rate. LinkedIn posts have the least.

* To conclude, I created a dashboard that shows all the relevant information in the dataset for easy viewing and presentation.
