## Process

* I created a horizontal bar chart to visualize the average clicks for each content category. The monthly newsletter got the most clicks by far, and from my analysis, this was likely because the newsletter was released once a month and contained information that was important to customers. This means that when the company wants to share crucial news or vital updates to their customers, they should add it to their newsletter to leverage viewership.
